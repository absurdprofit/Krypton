The Krypton Project

This project is aimed at providing a web user with a native experience. By that I mean, the user should be able to load a Krypton application on a website and feel as if they
are using an application that has been installed to their phone. An application made with Krypton should be able to utilise the camera, file system, accelerometer, orientation
etc.

The target platform for this project is the web, but specifically the mobile subset of web browsers.
